dotfiles
========

This is a collection of the dotfiles I use primarily on the Mac, but in Vim's case it also gets used on Windows.

As it stands, if you clone this repository you would have to manually create the symbolic links. I am looking to change this (if nothing else, for my own selfish needs).

In the mean time, they might act as some inspiration.
